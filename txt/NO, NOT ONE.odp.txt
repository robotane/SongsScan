NO, NOT ONE
There&apos;s not a friend like the lowly Jesus
No, not one! No, not one!
None else could heal all our souls&apos; diseases,
No, not one! No, not one!
Jesus knows all about our struggles;
He will guide till the day is done
There&apos;s not a friend like the lowly Jesus 
No, not one! No, not one!
No friend like Him is so high and holy
No, not one! No, not one!
And yet no friend is so meek and lowly,
No, not one! No, not one!
Jesus knows all about our struggles;
He will guide till the day is done
There&apos;s not a friend like the lowly Jesus 
No, not one! No, not one!
There&apos;s not an hour that He is not near us
No, not one! No, not one!
No, night so dark but His love can cheer us
No, not one! No, not one!
 
Jesus knows all about our struggles;
He will guide till the day is done
There&apos;s not a friend like the lowly Jesus 
No, not one! No, not one!
Did ever saint find this Friend forsake him ?
No, not one! No, not one!
Or sinner find that he would not take him?
No, not one! No, not one!
 
Jesus knows all about our struggles;
He will guide till the day is done
There&apos;s not a friend like the lowly Jesus 
No, not one! No, not one!
