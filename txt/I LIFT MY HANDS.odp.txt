I LIFT MY HANDS
I lift my hands 
(echo)
To the coming King 
(echo)
To the great I AM 
(echo)
To You I sing 
(echo)
For You’re the One 
(echo)
Who reigns within my heart 
(all)
And I will serve no foreign god,
Or any other treasure,
You are my heart’s desire
Spirit without measure
Unto Your name
I will bring my sacrifice
