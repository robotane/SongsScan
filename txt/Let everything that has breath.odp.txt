Let everything that has breath
 
Let everything that,
Everything that,
Everything that has breath,
Praise the Lord.

Praise You in the morning,
Praise you in the evening,
Praise You when I&apos;m young
And when I&apos;m old.
Praise You when I&apos;m laughing,
Praise You when I&apos;m grieving,
Praise You every season of the soul.
If we could see how much You&apos;re worth,
Your power, your might, your endless love,
Then surely we would never cease to praise
Let everything that,
Everything that,
Everything that has breath,
Praise the Lord.
(
Repeat
)
Praise you in the heavens.
Joining with the angels,
Praising you forever and a day.
Praise you on the earth now,
Joining with creation,
Calling all the nations to your praise.
If we could see how much You&apos;re worth,
Your power, your might, your endless love,
Then surely we would never cease to praise
Let everything that,
Everything that,
Everything that has breath,
Praise the Lord.
