I SURRENDER ALL
1. All to Jesus I surrender;
All to Him I freely give.
I will ever love and trust Him,
In His presence daily live
I surrender all
I surrender all
All to you, my blessed Saviour
I surrender all
2. All to Jesus I surrender;
Humbly at His feet i bow,
Wordly pleasures all forsaken
Take me, Jesus, take me now
I surrender all
I surrender all
All to you, my blessed Saviour
I surrender all
3. All to Jesus I surrender;
Make me, Saviour, wholly yours
Let me feel the Holy Spirit,
Truly know that you are mine
I surrender all
I surrender all
All to you, my blessed Saviour
I surrender all
4. All to Jesus I surrender;
Lord, I give myself to you
Fill me with your love and power
Let your blessing fall on me
I surrender all
I surrender all
All to you, my blessed Saviour
I surrender all
5. All to Jesus I surrender;
Now I fee the sacred flame
Oh, the joy of full salvation!
Glory, glory to his name!
I surrender all
I surrender all
All to you, my blessed Saviour
I surrender all
O
