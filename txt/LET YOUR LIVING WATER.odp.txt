LET YOUR LIVING WATER
Let your living water 
Flow over my soul
Let Your Holy Spirit 
Come and take control
Of every situation 
That has troubled my mind
All my cares and 
Burdens on to You I roll.
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.
Father, Father, Father.
Spirit, Spirit, Spirit.
Come now Holy Spirit and take control
Hold me in your loving arms and make me whole.
Wipe away all doubt and fear and
Take my pride.
Draw me to your love and keep me 
By your side 
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.
Father, Father, Father.
Spirit, Spirit, Spirit.
Give your life to Jesus, let him fill
Your soul
Let him take you in His arms and
Make you whole,
As you give your life in Him, He’ll
Set you free.
You will live and reign with Him 
Eternally. 
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.
Father, Father, Father.
Spirit, Spirit, Spirit.’’
